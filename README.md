IRIS AUV vision control for Stonefish

Still under development. Ghost net detecion runs on TensorFlow 2.5.0 and ROS Noetic (Ubuntu 20.04), based on various retrained models, such as efficientdet_d0, ssd_resnet50_v1 and ssd_mobilenet_v2 (see exported-models directory). Directory annotations contains a label_map, test and train records obtained from over a 1000 images.
